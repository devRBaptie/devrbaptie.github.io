                                        I have always enjoyed playing hockey whether it was in school or out of school. I find hockey is a great
                                        social activity and way to stay active.
                                        <br/> <br/>
                                        <h6>Technology</h6>I have always been drawn towards technology and find it easy to pick up new technologies. I enjoy keeping
                                        up to date on the latest tech in all industries from Tesla cars to robots at Boston Dynamics. With so many
                                        companies working on Artificial Intelligence, the future is looking interesting.

                                        <h6>Gaming</h6> My passion for tech and programming came from my love of gaming when I was younger. I was always
                                        fascinated by how technology progressed especially in the gaming industry as you can see progress from
                                        generation to generation.
                                        <br/> <br/>
                                        <h6>Traveling</h6>
                                        I have a passion for traveling abroad and experiencing the culture and history of a country.
